# Revature-project0

## Executive Summary 
The goal of Project 0 is to create a basic user/item management application. The type of items managed is completely up to you. (Foods? Animals? Books? Video Games?). The app shall include at least two database tables with a PK/FK relationship between them. For example, users and books, with every book belonging to one user. Imagine that this app is for admins managing the users and the items, not for the actual users themselves. 

## Tech Requirements
* Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL Database 
* The Java API sends SQL queries to the Database via JDBC. 
* The Java API uses Javalin to process HTTP Requests 
* HTTP Requests are sent via Postman.

## User Stories  
Users of the application can: 
* Select all items from the items table 
* Select all items that belong to a certain user (find items by user id) 
* Insert a new item into the items table 
* Insert a new user into the users table 
* Update a user 
* Delete an item 
* [A functionality of your choice – must be a CRUD operation or cooler]
